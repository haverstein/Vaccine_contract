# Vaccine Program

I know it is a very basic level program. But let me know if I can make any changes related to gas optimization, adding new functionalities or anything else.Also any comment about the repo is highly appreciated.

## What does it do?

1. It registers a user(citizen) for vaccination (with overly non reliable and simplistic data).
2. It updates their status after receiving the first doze.(only by owner)
3. It updates their status after receiving the second doze.(only by owner)
4. It checks for buffer and deadline in between dozes.
5. User(citizen) can check their status of vaccination.

Yeah! thats all what it does(for now) :)

Thank you very much to spent time reading this and also (hopefully) my programs.
